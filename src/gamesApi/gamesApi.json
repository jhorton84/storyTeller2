In these times of strife, a group of youths approaches the village of Tsuma for the Topaz Championship and their gempuku, the coming-of-age ceremony that will mark them as fully fledged samurai. Each contestant has come from a different clan and dreams of being the highest-scoring contestant in the tournament, earning the title of Topaz Champion. Despite being pitted against one another, they are all united in their desire to succeed and bring honor to their clan and family."

Goblins, demons, and the unliving are not honorable foes, and Hida Defenders cannot afford to behave as though the fight against these creatures is fair. While any warrior with a strong will can attempt to slay a stone-skinned oni or die in the attempt, the Hida Defenders know their duty is to endure. From their heavily plated armor to their techniques for shattering iron hides with mighty hammer blows, Hida Defenders have developed an armory and fighting style that gives them the utmost advantage and greatest chance of not just victory, but survival."
